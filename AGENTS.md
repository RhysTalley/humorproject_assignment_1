This is a class project designed around using AI to help build projects on top of a real production level database inside supabase.

The only necessary schema right now is the schema for the "images" table. The complete schema for this table is located inside `schema.sql`.

Supabase-generated types are stored in `src/types/supabase.ts`. Reference this file for types instead of re-ingesting schema text.
